This project demonstrates how to control more than 64 switches using an Arduino Nano and multiple 74HC595 shift registers. By utilizing just 3 data pins on the Arduino, the shift registers expand the number of output pins, allowing efficient control of a large number of switches or LEDs. The code and wiring setup in this repository provide an effective solution for minimizing pin usage while maximizing output control.
